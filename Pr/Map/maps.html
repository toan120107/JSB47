        <h1>Certainly! Here is a comparison of living spaces in the past and present:</h1>
        <br>
        <span>In the past, homes were typically smaller and simpler, often constructed with locally sourced materials
            such as wood, stone, or clay. These houses were designed to meet basic needs and usually lacked modern
            amenities like electricity, running water, and indoor plumbing. Heating was often provided by fireplaces or
            wood stoves, and lighting came from candles or oil lamps. The emphasis was on functionality, with rooms
            serving multiple purposes, and furniture was often handcrafted and minimalistic.
        </span>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span>

            Today, modern homes are significantly larger and more complex, reflecting advancements in technology and
            changes in lifestyle. Contemporary houses are equipped with a wide range of amenities, including central
            heating and cooling systems, electricity, indoor plumbing, and high-speed internet. The use of advanced
            building materials and construction techniques has improved the durability and energy efficiency of homes.
            Modern living spaces are designed with comfort and convenience in mind, featuring specialized rooms such as
            home offices, gyms, and entertainment centers. Additionally, there is a greater focus on aesthetics, with a
            variety of architectural styles and interior designs available to suit individual preferences.
        </span>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span>

            In summary, while homes in the past were built for practicality and basic needs, modern homes are designed
            to provide a higher standard of living, offering numerous amenities and greater comfort.</span>
