                <h1>Launcher with addons (mods) Minecraft: Pocket Edition</h1>
                <p>Installing a couple of add-ons is an excellent idea for maximum immersion in the atmosphere of the
                    game. After all, there are already tens of thousands of various modifications that will change your
                    world beyond recognition. Our launcher gives access to a rich base of add-ons.</p>
                <p>All of them have descriptions and screenshots in English, so you can easily determine the purpose of
                    the mod. One-touch installation eliminates the need to connect your phone via cable and manually
                    download add-ons. Our launcher will do it for you!</p>
                <p>Our application provides easy control of downloaded objects. They can be easily disabled or
                    permanently deleted. There is no more need to look through the file manager and search for the
                    folder with the game. The game is controlled through the application. We simplify the life of our
                    players!</p>

                <h1>Thousands of textures in your smartphone</h1>
                <p>You can change the displayed blocks in Minecraft using new textures. The catalog of our launcher
                    numbers more than one thousand textures. By the way, you can change not only the blocks, but also
                    the sounds and individual elements of the game. You will be notified about this by our description
                    of each texture. So, you will always know what you are installing into the game. You can use our
                    launcher to remove the texture from your world in one click at any moment. Thus, you will make room
                    for new textures when you are no longer interested in the old one.</p>

                <h1>Skins with TLauncher PE</h1>
                <p>A skin is an image of your character in the game, so you need to choose it carefully. Our catalog has
                    more than five thousand unique skins of various directions and features. You will definitely have
                    plenty to choose from. No matter whether you want to become a knight or a villain, here you can find
                    the best skin for this in a couple of minutes.

                    The installation of the skin in Minecraft: Pocket Edition is very simple. You just need to download
                    the desired skin from the catalog, enter the game, select the TLauncher PE application in the skin
                    setup menu, and then activate the skin selected earlier.

                    Without any exaggeration, the catalog is filled with new products every five minutes. You can check
                    it yourself. Just download TLauncher PE and wait a little bit in the application of the skin
                    catalog. Then pull up to update the list, and new skins will be waiting for your downloads!</p>

                <h1>Seed values</h1>
                <p>Seeds are unique values used to generate random worlds. The launcher has a special seed catalog,
                    where you can find interesting options for generating the world, for example, near a village or in a
                    certain biome. This is very helpful when you need to start the game in a certain place. Here you can
                    always find great spawn locations! The collection of our seeds is constantly replenished. Therefore,
                    we recommend you to visit us from time to time. Perhaps we have something that you long have been

                    Linux. We try to cover all the gamers who decide to use our program, so the TLauncher PE project
                    will also be a cross-platform app. We have already developed a launcher for Android devices. It
                    provides rich functionality and continues to evolve. We are preparing for the development of the
                    application for iOS devices. The release date is not precisely known, but it is likely to be the
                    beginning of 2020..</p>
